## My Journey üåü

### Latest Project: [Lay-Off](https://github.com/AlexBuzmion/layoff)
"Lay-Off" is a high-stakes, 4-player online multiplayer game where elite spies compete in a thrilling battle of wits and traps. It‚Äôs been an incredible project, showcasing my skills in gameplay programming, network management, and HUD design‚Äîall crafted in Unity.

### [Telemetry Web App](https://github.com/AlexBuzmion/layoff_webapp)
I developed a sophisticated telemetry web application using Vue.js and Node.js, integrated with Unity Cloud Services and Unity API's. This project involved collecting and analyzing player data in real-time to provide actionable insights for gameplay balancing and optimization.

### [Rogue Protocol](https://github.com/AlexBuzmion/rogueprotocol)
"Rogue Protocol" is another project where I focused on creating a compelling gameplay experience. The project included implementing complex gameplay mechanics and optimizing performance for an engaging and smooth player experience.

### Previous Work
- **RoboDash:** Developed an endless runner in Unreal Engine, with dynamic path creation and challenging obstacles.
- **Stick Dots:** Brought a classic game to life, managing the project and leading the team through code reviews and development.
